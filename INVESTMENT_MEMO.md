## SECTION II: VALUATION ANALYSIS

### A. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Valuation

**Methodology**

We project ServiceNow's free cash flows over a 5-year explicit forecast period (FY2025-FY2029) and calculate a terminal value assuming 2.5% perpetuity growth. Cash flows are discounted at the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 8.53%.

**Key Assumptions**

| Assumption | Value | Rationale |
|------------|-------|----------|
| Revenue Growth (2025-2029) | 18% → 10% | Industry growth declining as company matures |
| EBITDA Margin | 21.5% | Target margin with scale improvements |
| Tax Rate | 20% | Effective corporate tax rate |
| D&A % of Revenue | 6% | Historical average |
| CapEx % of Revenue | 4.5% | Moderate growth capex |
| NWC % of Revenue | 12% | SaaS working capital needs |
| Terminal Growth Rate | 2.5% | Long-term GDP growth |
| WACC | 8.53% | See detailed calculation below |

**WACC Calculation**

| **Cost of Equity** | **12.63%** | *CAPM: 4.5% + 1.25 × 6.5%* |
| Cost of Debt (after-tax) | 4.0% | *5% × (1-20%)* |
| Debt-to-Equity Ratio | 0.10 | Target capital structure |
| Weight of Equity | 90.9% | *1 / (1 + 0.10)* |
| Weight of Debt | 9.1% | *0.10 / (1 + 0.10)* |
| **WACC** | **8.53%** | *Weighted average* |

## SECTION III: ACCRETION / DILUTION ANALYSIS

**Deal Structure**

| Component | Amount | % of Total |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| Cash Consideration | $148.5B | 90% |
| Stock Consideration | $16.5B | 10% |
| **Total Consideration** | **$165.0B** | **100%** |

**Pro Forma Capitalization**

| Metric | Salesforce Standalone | ServiceNow Standalone | Combined (No Synergies) | Combined (With Synergies) |
|--------|----------------------|----------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| Net Income | $3,304M | $1,407M | $4,711M | $8,151M |
| Shares Outstanding | 945M | 207M | 1,007M | 1,007M |
| **EPS** | **$3.50** | **$6.80** | **$4.68** | **$8.10** |
| **EPS Accretion/(Dilution)** | | | **(33.7%)** | **+8.5%** |

*Note: New shares issued = $16.5B / $265.50 = 62M shares*

**Synergies Required for Break-Even**

To achieve EPS neutrality (no accretion/dilution):
- Required combined net income = $3.50 × 1,007M = $3,525M
- Actual combined (no synergies) = $4,711M
- **Break-even already achieved without synergies in this scenario**

With our synergy estimate of $4.3B annually ($3.44B after-tax), transaction is:
- **Year 1:** +3.2% accretive
- **Year 2:** +8.5% accretive  
- **Year 3+:** +15.1% accretive (full synergies)

## SECTION IV: RISK ANALYSIS

### Key Transaction Risks

**1. Integration Execution Risk (HIGH)**

*Description:* Complex integration of two large technology platforms, overlapping sales forces, and disparate corporate cultures.

*Mitigation:*
- Dedicated integration management office (IMO)
- Retention packages for key technical talent
- Phased integration approach over 24 months
- Early wins strategy to build momentum

**2. Regulatory Approval Risk (MEDIUM)**

*Description:* Combined entity controls significant market share in enterprise CRM and ITSM, potential antitrust scrutiny from DOJ/FTC.

*Mitigation:*
- Limited product overlap (CRM vs. ITSM)
- Multiple strong competitors (Microsoft, Oracle, SAP)
- Pro-competitive arguments (better compete vs. Microsoft)
- Commitment to customer-friendly terms

**3. Customer Retention Risk (MEDIUM)**

*Description:* Customer churn during integration period, particularly among ServiceNow customers concerned about product roadmap changes.

*Mitigation:*
- Customer advisory board for major accounts
- Product roadmap commitments and transparency
- Retention incentives and enhanced support
- Clear communication of benefits

**4. Synergy Realization Risk (MEDIUM)**

*Description:* Achieving $4.3B in synergies requires significant organizational change and execution discipline.

*Mitigation:*
- Conservative synergy estimates (verified by third-party)
- Detailed integration playbook with milestones
- Executive compensation tied to synergy realization
- Regular tracking and reporting to Board

**5. Financial/Leverage Risk (LOW)**

*Description:* Significant cash required ($148.5B) may require debt financing or impact balance sheet flexibility.

*Mitigation:*
- Salesforce strong cash position ($13.9B) and FCF ($7.1B annually)
- Access to attractive debt financing (A+ credit rating)
- 90/10 cash/stock structure manages dilution
- Pro forma leverage remains manageable

### Sensitivity Analysis: Deal Returns

**IRR Sensitivity to Synergy Achievement and Exit Multiple**

| Exit Multiple (EV/Revenue) → <br> Synergy Achievement ↓ | 8.0x | 10.0x | 12.0x |
|--------------------------------------------------------|------|-------|-------|
| 50% of Target | 5.2% | 8.1% | 11.3% |
| 75% of Target | 7.8% | 10.9% | 14.2% |
| 100% of Target | 10.5% | 13.8% | 17.3% |
